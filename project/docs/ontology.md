# Terminology



Hello for the research of a paper I need good scientific resources I can use for a paragraph about ontologies. In this paragraph I want to give a basic definition of an ontology and a knowledge base. Here I follow the following definition: "[..] and ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse, properties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept, and restrictions on slots, An ontology together with a set of individual instances of classes constitutes a knowledge base." I would further find good resources of where ontologies showed success in increasing the findability or knowledge bases helped in similarity search
