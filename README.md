# MIAPPExSOSA

The integration of proximal sensing, robotics, and remote sensing into plant phenotyping has created an interdisciplinary data landscape that is vast and complex. While enabling non-destructive measurements under field conditions, these technologies generate heterogeneous datasets that challenge effective data management and interoperability. Current metadata standards, such as the Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE), provide a crucial foundation but lack explicit constructs for describing sensors, platforms, and computational workflows central to modern, technology-driven phenotyping. This hinders the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) of data and limits the potential for advanced data integration and analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel, ontology-based data model that semantically extends MIAPPE by integrating concepts from the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN/SOSA) ontology. This model formalizes the relationship between biological studies, observational procedures, sensor systems, and derived data, creating a unified framework for documenting interdisciplinary field phenotyping experiments. A primary objective of this model is to serve as a canonical schema for converting disparate, tabular phenotyping metadata into a structured, machine-readable knowledge graph. This graph representation is not only inherently FAIR but also provides the foundational structure for future applications, such as the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) to discover contextual patterns across experiments.
